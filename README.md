# 🐧 Oly's Linux Dotfiles & Configs

A collection of my personal Linux configuration files, scripts, and UI experiments. This repository is primarily focused on my **Sway WM** setup on Wayland.

---

## Main Setup: Sway + Wayland
The current active heart of this repository. Everything here is customized for productivity and a clean Catppuccin-based aesthetic.

### 🛰️ Waybar (Status Bar)
A full-featured status bar with custom modules for system monitoring and workspace management.
* **Theme:** Catppuccin
* **Location:** `Sway-Config/waybar/catppuccin-full`

### Eww (Widgets)
Custom widgets built with `eww` to handle media playback and system controls.
* **Location:** `Sway-Config/eww`
