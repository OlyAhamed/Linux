# 🐧 Personal Linux Configurations

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This repo contains my custom configurations for **Sway**, featuring a heavy focus on aesthetics with **Catppuccin** and custom **Eww** widgets.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Note for Visitors:** These files are heavily tailored for my specific hardware and personal workflow. Things might not be "plug-and-play" or immediately clear. If you are looking for a specific script or config, please explore the directories manually.
